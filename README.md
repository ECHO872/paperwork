Paperwork is an open-source, self-hosted alternative to services like Evernote ¬Æ, Microsoft OneNote ¬Æ or Google Keep ¬Æ

## Version 2

This branch contains the second iteration of Paperwork, which is a complete rewrite. Not only is it based on another framework - it is based on a completely different technology stack. **It is in its very early development phase and not yet usable**.

*If you were looking for the Laravel-based version 1 of Paperwork, please check [out this branch](https://github.com/paperwork/paperwork/tree/1).*

### I would love to help!

Feel free to check out this branch and get involved with what's there already to get an idea of where Paperwork is heading. Also check out the [project board](https://github.com/paperwork/paperwork/projects/1) to see what needs to be done or suggest what and how should be done.

Feel free to actively participate in the [chatroom](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#paperwork:matrix.org).

## Usage

This repository is structuring and unifying all required components for Paperwork.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:paperwork/paperwork.git
```

### Docker Stack

In order to easily get Paperwork running as a Docker stack, utilizing whichever orchestrator you'd like, this repository comes with a handy Makefile. Let's have a look at it:

```bash
$ make help
```

Launching the Paperwork can be done by make`-ing the `deploy` target:

```bash
$ make deploy
```

The Makefile then takes care of initializing Swarm, in case you haven't done that already, creating the encrypted network (`papernet`) and deploying the Paperwork stack on top of it.

In order to stop/remove the whole stack, simply use the `undeploy` target:

```bash
$ make undeploy
```

Note: This won't make your Docker host leave Swarm again, in case it wasn't running in Swarm mode before deploying! If you'd like to turn off Swarm, you have to manually do so.

#### Orchestrator

If you'd like to use a different orchestrator for stack deployment, you can do so by setting the `ORCHESTRATOR` variable on deploy:

```bash
$ make deploy ORCHESTRATOR=kubernetes
```

For more info, check the official Docker documentation [for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/kubernetes/#override-the-default-orchestrator) and [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/kubernetes/#override-the-default-orchestrator).
